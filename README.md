# Bike_Rental
The objective of this project is to predict the demand of bike rental count based on the environmental and seasonal settings. Our data consists of different environmental parameters based on which we have to make a model which will predict a number for us, denoting the number of bikes will be demanded at a particular place depending upon the weather condition, day of week, month and different other parameters.
